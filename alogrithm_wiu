Description:
-------------------------------------------
A script/program created with Python3 to process date of birth data formatted such as "YYYY-MM-DD" and convert to standard format like "November 24, 2020".
-------------------------------------------
Algorithm (Of code inside):
-------------------------------------------
(1) Define the built-in system functions to allow functionality of the script through import.

	import os
	import sys
	import subprocess
		
(2) Define a function with code to determine that the year in the date of the format is a leap year from data.
	
	define leap_year(obj):
		- Include if statements to see if the years are dividable in the given increments (4, 100, 400)
		- If obj is not dividable then it's not leap year, otherwise it is.
		- Return values to status.
	
(3) Define a function with code to ensure that the special characters inside the different date formats such as YYYY-MM-DD are removed to allow analysis of the given year, month and day from the data.
	
	define sanitize(obj1, obj2):
		- 

(4) Define a function with code to ensure that the length of the date format after extraction is correct.

	def size_check(obj, intobj):
		- Statement to check the 

(5) Define a function with code that'll create a minimum and maximum range for years that are allowed (i.e 1900 or later...) as well as the range of months to ensure realistic information from the given data.

	def range_check(obj1, obj2):
		-

(6) Define a function with code to allow the usage of the data to be read and extracted with the script.

	def usage(): 
		-

(7) As provided with the given code at the end of the script will call the created functions as well as the data to process, convert and output the results.
