Description:
-------------------------------------------
A script/program created with Python3 to process date of birth data formatted such as "YYYY-MM-DD" and convert to standard format like "November 24, 2020".
-------------------------------------------
Algorithm (Of code inside):
-------------------------------------------
(1) Define the built-in system functions to allow functionality of the script through import.

	import os
	import sys
		
(2) Define a function with code to determine that the year in the date of the format is a leap year from data.
	
	define leap_year(obj):
		- Include if statements to see if the years are dividable in the given increments (4, 100, 400)
		- If year is not dividable then it's not leap year, otherwise it is.
		- Return values to year
	
(3) Define a function with code to ensure that the special characters inside the different date formats such as YYYY-MM-DD are removed to allow analysis of the given year, month and day from the data.
	
	define sanitize(obj1, obj2):
		- have obj1 bound towards user_raw_data with a string method used to help replace the special characters
		- 
		- <still thinking/processing>

(4) Define a function with code to ensure that the length of the date format after extraction is correct.

	def size_check(obj, intobj):
		- <still thinking/processing>

(5) Define a function with code that'll create a minimum and maximum range for years that are allowed (i.e 1900 or later...) as well as the range of months to ensure realistic information from the given data.

	def range_check(obj1, obj2):
		- <still thinking/processing>

(6) Define a function with code to allow the usage of the data to be read and extracted with the script.

	def usage(): 
		- Use a print statement to show how to use the program if the user fails to input correctly.
		- Returned towards len(sys.argv)

(7) As provided with the given code at the end of the script will call the created functions as well as the data to process, convert and output the results.
